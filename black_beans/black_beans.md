1 1/2 green peppers, stemmed and seeded
10 garlic cloves
1 pound dried black beans, rinsed and picked over to remove any stones
1 smoked ham hock (optional)
2 bay leaves
5 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
4 slices thick bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 Spanish onion, diced
1 jalapeño, stemmed and finely chopped
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1 tablespoon turbinado or other brown sugar


Cut 1 green pepper into 1-inch squares. Smash and peel 4 of the garlic cloves.
Put the green pepper and garlic into a large pot with the beans, ham hock, bay
leaves and 1 tablespoon salt. Add 2 quarts water and bring to a boil. Cover the
pot and simmer until the beans are tender, an hour or more.

Meanwhile, make a sofrito. Cut the remaining ½ green pepper into ¼-inch dice.
Peel and finely chop the remaining garlic. Heat the olive oil in a very large
skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally,
until it starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the green pepper and onion and
cook, stirring, until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic,
jalapeño (leave out the seeds if you don’t want it too spicy), oregano, cumin,
black pepper and 2 teaspoons salt and stir for another minute. Pour in the
vinegar and scrape any browned bits from bottom of pan with a wooden spoon.
This is your sofrito.

When the beans are cooked, discard the bay leaf. Remove and set aside the ham
hock and let it cool. Transfer 1 cup of beans to small bowl, mash them into a
paste with the back of a fork and return to the pot. Add the sofrito, then the
sugar. Pull the meat from the ham hock, leaving behind any white sinew or
gristle. Chop the ham into ½-inch pieces and return it to the bean pot.

Stir the beans well and bring to a boil over medium heat, then lower to a
simmer and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes or so, skimming any foam from the
top. Taste for salt and serve with white rice.
