### Dough

By weight:

- 94% Bread flour
- 6% Whole wheat flour
- 67% Water
- 15% Levain / Starter
- 2.9% Salt
- 1% Instant / active dry yeast

To make two, 330g portions of dough for two ~14" pizzas:

- 350g Bread flour
- 21g Whole wheat flour
- 250g Water
- 56g Levain / Starter
- 11g Salt
- 3g Instant / active dry yeast

**Instructions:**

1. Combine all ingredients into the bowl of stand mixer if using, otherwise combine all ingredients in a big bowl.
2. Using the dough hook, mix and knead the dough for 4-5 minutes until a smooth dough forms. If mixing by hand, mix the ingredients together well and then dump out onto a surface and knead the dough for roughly 10 minutes until the dough is elastic and smooth. It should stretch without tearing.
3. Spray a bowl with nonstick spray and place your dough ball in the center. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise 2 hours at room temperature (~75º)
4. After 2 hours, perform a stretch and fold. Moisten your hands and stretch the dough from one side over to the other side, rotate 90º and do this again until you've folded the dough over itself about 4 times. This will help develop the structure of your dough. Cover your dough back up with the plastic wrap to keep it from drying.
5. After another 2 to 3 hours, repeat this process.
6. After another hour, dump out your dough onto an unfloured work surface.
7. Divide the dough into roughly equal portions.
8. Taking one ball of dough at a time, pull the edges of the dough into the center of the dough all the way around the dough. Flip the dough over, you should have a roughly smooth dough ball starting to form. The goal is to form some tension into the top of the dough, like a taught water balloon. Place your hands behind the dough ball and pull forward with your pinkies pushing the ball forward. The friction from the work surface should cause the dough to form into a nice taught ball. Turn the dough 90º and repeat until you have a nice, taught dough ball.
9. Place your shaped doughball onto a sheet pan sprayed with nonstick spray.
10. Repeat with the second doughball, sprinkle the doughballs with a bit of flour to prevent sticking  and cover the sheet pan with another upside down sheet pan to let the balls rise for their final proof.
11. Let the dough rest for another 1 - 2 hours until you are ready to bake them.


### Pizza Sauce

- 1tsp fresh or dry thyme
- 1/2 of a 28oz Can San Marzano tomatoes, blended smooth in a blender
- 4 Garlic Cloves

**Instructions:**

1. Crush your garlic cloves and discard the paper skin. No need to chop the garlic further
2. Combine all ingredients and either bake in an oven safe container at 350º or simmer on your stovetop for 30-45 minutes.


### Pesto Sauce

- 4oz Olive Oil
- 2 Garlic Cloves
- 1oz Lemon Juice (add more if you like!)
- 4oz by volume Walnuts
- 4oz by volume Parmigiano
- 8-12oz by volume fresh Parsley
- 8-12oz by volume fresh Basil Leaves
- 12-16 oz by volume of fresh Arugula
- Salt and Pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Combine ingredients into the bowl of a food processor.
2. Blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the food processor as needed. Add more olive oil to adjust the consistency and salt and pepper to taste.

### Meatballs

- 1lb ground chuck
- 4oz Breadcrumbs
- 2oz finely chopped Onion
- 2.5oz Parmigiano
- 1/4tsp nutmeg (really just a pinch of fresh grated if you have it)
- 1tsp dry Oregano
- 1 clove finely chopped garlic (I use a microplane)
- 1 egg
- 2-3oz heavy cream to hydrate bread crumbs
- Salt and pepper

**Note**. The recipe above makes enough meatballs for ~3 pizzas but it's hard to scale to smaller than a pound of meat and one egg.

**Instructions:**

1. Combine all ingredients into a large bowl.
2. Mix ingredients well and add enough heavy cream to hydrate the breadcrumbs and bind the mixture together.
3. Form the mixture into ~3/4" meatballs. Not too big since they will need to cook quickly on the pizza itself.
4. Place in the fridge until ready to use.

### Other Ingredients Needed

- 16oz low moisture, whole milk mozzarella
- Sesame seeds for the crust
- Fresh Basil for garnish
- Chile de Árbol, thinly sliced for garnish


## Pizza Instructions

If you don't have a sourdough starter already, follow the instructions in the beginning of [this sourdough bread recipe video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FVfJTGpXnU). You'll want a well fed, active starter for this recipe to get the right flavor and rise. The addition of a small percentage of bakers yeast will provide a bit more gas production for nice blisters in the crust. It's totally possible to do this recipe without the commercial yeast, just make sure your starter is in great health and be gentle during your shaping.

The order of operations is roughly:

1. The night before, if your starter is in the fridge, take it out and let it rise to room temperature overnight. It's not a bad idea to give it a feed now even and let it munch overnight.
2. 8:00 AM on Pizza Day™. Feed your starter. For my white flour starter I like to feed it 100g of flour and 80g of water (80% hydration).
3. Put your pizza steel or pizza stone in the oven on the second to lowest shelf. If you don't have one, try using an inverted cookie sheet.
4. Make your pesto, pasta sauce, and pizza sauce. You can make one of either the pasta or pizza sauce and use it for both if you want, it will still be great. Stash them in the fridge for later.
5. Prep your meatballs and stash them in the fridge raw for later.
6. 12:00 PM You starter should be at it's peak and show clear signs of activity with nice bubbles forming. Make your dough according to the instructions above
7. 6:00 PM Preheat your oven to 550ºF.
8. Cook a small portion of spaghetti, no one knows how to measure how much spaghetti to cook so good luck.
9. 7:00 PM Your dough, already portioned according to the instructions above, is done proofing.
10. Lightly flour your work surface and bring over one of your dough balls. Lightly dust the top of the dough. Using your fingertips work your way around the crust pushing in about a half inch from the rim to form a crust. You want to keep as much trapped air inside the outer crust portion so treat that part gently from now on. Once you've defined the crust, knock back some of the air from the center of the dough. Pick up the dough and drape it over your knuckles and rotate the dough slowly in the air to gently and slowly stretch out the center of the dough. You dont want it to tear but you want it to get roughly uniform in thickness and pretty thin. Light should come through it which will tell you which parts need to be stretched more and where the dough is already thin.
11. Transfer your stretched dough to a pizza peel or a cutting board lined with a piece of parchment paper. The parchment paper will make it much easier to slide the pizza into the oven.
12. Brush the outer rim with olive oil and sprinkle sesame seeds onto the oiled crust.
13. Ladle on your pizza sauce to the edge and place your raw meatballs on the pizza. Leave a spot in the middle.
14. Transfer your pizza to your pizza stone and bake for 5 to 6 minutes. Your crust should puff up dramatically and start to brown while the meatballs cook.
15. During this 5-6 minutes, toss your pre-cooked spaghetti with your pasta sauce in a preheated pan.
15. Pull the pizza out of the oven and add your shredded mozzarella. Place the pizza back in the oven for another 2-3 minutes until your cheese is nice and melted. Once your cheese is melted and your crust is nice with some dark brown spots and blistering, pull your pizza out of the oven.
16. Slice your pizza into strips!
17. Dollop on pesto sauce where you please, grate more parmigiano over the crust.
18. Transfer your spaghetti to the center of the pizza and garnish with basil, fresh cracked pepper, thin slices of chile de árbol, and more parmigiano.
