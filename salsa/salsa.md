Lucy’s recipe:
Salsa de Molcajete

Ingredients:
 6 chile serranos
4 habanero chiles
2 roma tomatoes
3 tomatillos
½ white onion
3 garlic heads
1 tsp salt (or more to taste)
½ tsp black pepper
 ¼ cup cold water

Instructions:
Peel off the paper layers of the garlic and onion, and 3 tomatillos
Remove the stem of the chili serranos, 4 habanero chiles.
Cut ½ of the white onion into 4 pieces.
Roast all of the 6 chile serranos, 4 Habanero chiles, 2 roma tomatoes, 3 tomatillos, 4 pieces of the ½ of the white onion and 3 garlic heads in a hot comal until they’re darkly roasted. Make sure to flip them over on all their sides. The garlic, and the tomatillos will roast faster so put aside when you see them roasted. Keep roasting the larger ingredients until they’re darkly roasted. (5-6 Min)
Crush all the roasted ingredients in a molcajete (mortar) until all the ingredients are finely chopped.
Add ¼ tsp black pepper, ¼ cup cold water and 1 tsp salt to the crush ingredients.
Ready to serve in the molcajete or in a bowl.
